While sometimes difficult to date exactly, the rock art and inscriptions appear to represent periods from prehistory through Nabataean times right up to the present.</p>

           <p>The Damascus-Medina Hejaz Railway was constructed between 1900 and 1908 and the section to Al Ula officially opened on 1 September 1907. A major railway station complex was built at Mada’in Saleh, and large facilities were provided at Al Ula. Railway stations, bridges, and the track-bed still provide tangible evidence. The Hejaz Railway is a candidate for the UNESCO World Heritage list.</p>

Very little is known about them, but they are thought to be related to funerary and/or memorial practices. They are believed to date back to prehistory; excavations as part of IDIHA will hopefully shed more light on this.</p>

            <p>This town consisting of mud brick houses is probably at least a 1000 years old and was still in use in the 1970s. Buildings are typically two floors, constructed from sandstone, mudbrick, and palm trees, and usually one of the upper rooms hangs over the street, thereby shading it. Most of the roofs are now collapsed, but many walls are still standing.</p>
